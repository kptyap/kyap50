0.  BMP: 16m, GIF 256M, PNG 256T, JPEG 16m
1.  GIF supports animation
2.  Lossless means that the image is made smaller, but at no detriment to the quality. Lossy means the image is made (even) smaller, but at a detriment to the quality
3.  JPEG
4.  Reference of the address to the file is removed
5.  Overwrite everything several times by using proper sanitisation tools
6.  stdint.h  = stdint.h is a header file in the C standard library introduced in the C99 standard library section 7.18 to allow programmers to write more portable code by providing a set of typedefs that specify exact-width integer types, by way of macros.
7.  To allocate exactly that amount of space eg. 8 bytes
8.  BYTE = 1byte or 8 bits / DWORD = 4 bytes or 32 bits / LONG = 4 bytes or 32 bits / WORD = 2 bytes or 16 bits
9.  0x42 0x4D is the first 2 bytes used to identify BMP
10.  Bisize is the size required by the structure, bfsize is the overall size of the bmp file.
biwidth counts number of meaningful pixels per line excl padding. bfsize includes all.
11. If biHeight is negative, the bitmap is a top-down DIB and its origin is the upper left corner
12. biBitCount
13. fopen might return null as the output could not be created and hence does not exist
14. Copy is only reading and creating one file at a time, hence 3rd argument specifiying max items to be read is 1.

15. padding = 3.  (sizeof RGB triple is also 3)
16. he fseek function moves the file pointer (if any) associated with stream to a new location that is offset bytes from origin. 
17. SEEK_CUR is current position of file pointer
18. TODO
